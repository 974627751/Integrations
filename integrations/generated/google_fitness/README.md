## Description
Stores and accesses user data in the fitness store from apps on any platform.

## Actions
### oauthCallback
Exchange the code passed to your redirect URI for an access_token


```js
google_fitness.oauthCallback({
  "code": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* code (string) **required**

### oauthRefresh
Exchange a refresh_token for an access_token


```js
google_fitness.oauthRefresh(null, context)
```


### users.dataSources.list
Lists all data sources that are visible to the developer, using the OAuth scopes provided. The list is not exhaustive; the user may have private data sources that are only visible to other developers, or calls using other scopes.


```js
google_fitness.users.dataSources.list({
  "userId": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* userId (string) **required** - List data sources for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.
* dataTypeName (array) - The names of data types to include in the list. If not specified, all data sources will be returned.
* alt (string) - Data format for the response.
* fields (string) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
* key (string) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
* oauth_token (string) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
* prettyPrint (boolean) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
* quotaUser (string) - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
* userIp (string) - IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.

### users.dataSources.create
Creates a new data source that is unique across all data sources belonging to this user. The data stream ID field can be omitted and will be generated by the server with the correct format. The data stream ID is an ordered combination of some fields from the data source. In addition to the data source fields reflected into the data source ID, the developer project number that is authenticated when creating the data source is included. This developer project number is obfuscated when read by any other developer reading public data types.


```js
google_fitness.users.dataSources.create({
  "userId": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* userId (string) **required** - Create the data source for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.
* body (object) - Definition of a unique source of sensor data. Data sources can expose raw data coming from hardware sensors on local or companion devices. They can also expose derived data, created by transforming or merging other data sources. Multiple data sources can exist for the same data type. Every data point inserted into or read from this service has an associated data source.
* alt (string) - Data format for the response.
* fields (string) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
* key (string) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
* oauth_token (string) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
* prettyPrint (boolean) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
* quotaUser (string) - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
* userIp (string) - IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.

### users.dataSources.delete
