* DataType `object`
  * field `array`: A field represents one dimension of a data type.
    * items [DataTypeField](#datatypefield)
  * name `string`: Each data type has a unique, namespaced, name. All data types in the com.google namespace are shared as part of the platform.

### DataTypeField
* DataTypeField `object`: In case of multi-dimensional data (such as an accelerometer with x, y, and z axes) each field represents one dimension. Each data type field has a unique name which identifies it. The field also defines the format of the data (int, float, etc.).
  * format `string` (values: blob, floatList, floatPoint, integer, integerList, map, string): The different supported formats for each field in a data type.
  * name `string`: Defines the name and format of data. Unlike data type names, field names are not namespaced, and only need to be unique within the data type.
  * optional `boolean`

### Dataset
* Dataset `object`: A dataset represents a projection container for data points. They do not carry any info of their own. Datasets represent a set of data points from a particular data source. A data point can be found in more than one dataset.
  * dataSourceId `string`: The data stream ID of the data source that created the points in this dataset.
  * maxEndTimeNs `string`: The largest end time of all data points in this possibly partial representation of the dataset. Time is in nanoseconds from epoch. This should also match the first part of the dataset identifier.
  * minStartTimeNs `string`: The smallest start time of all data points in this possibly partial representation of the dataset. Time is in nanoseconds from epoch. This should also match the first part of the dataset identifier.
  * nextPageToken `string`: This token will be set when a dataset is received in response to a GET request and the dataset is too large to be included in a single response. Provide this value in a subsequent GET request to return the next page of data points within this dataset.
  * point `array`: A partial list of data points contained in the dataset, ordered by largest endTimeNanos first. This list is considered complete when retrieving a small dataset and partial when patching a dataset or retrieving a dataset that is too large to include in a single response.
    * items [DataPoint](#datapoint)

### Device
* Device `object`: Representation of an integrated device (such as a phone or a wearable) that can hold sensors. Each sensor is exposed as a data source.
  * manufacturer `string`: Manufacturer of the product/hardware.
  * model `string`: End-user visible model name for the device.
  * type `string` (values: chestStrap, headMounted, phone, scale, tablet, unknown, watch): A constant representing the type of the device.
  * uid `string`: The serial number or other unique ID for the hardware. This field is obfuscated when read by any REST or Android client that did not create the data source. Only the data source creator will see the uid field in clear and normal form.
  * version `string`: Version string for the device hardware/software.

### ListDataPointChangesResponse
* ListDataPointChangesResponse `object`
  * dataSourceId `string`: The data stream ID of the data source with data point changes.
  * deletedDataPoint `array`: Deleted data points for the user. Note, for modifications this should be parsed before handling insertions.
    * items [DataPoint](#datapoint)
  * insertedDataPoint `array`: Inserted data points for the user.
    * items [DataPoint](#datapoint)
  * nextPageToken `string`: The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of results.

### ListDataSourcesResponse
* ListDataSourcesResponse `object`
  * dataSource `array`: A previously created data source.
    * items [DataSource](#datasource)

### ListSessionsResponse
* ListSessionsResponse `object`
  * deletedSession `array`: If includeDeleted is set to true in the request, this list will contain sessions deleted with original end times that are within the startTime and endTime frame.
    * items [Session](#session)
  * hasMoreData `boolean`: Flag to indicate server has more data to transfer
  * nextPageToken `string`: The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of results.
  * session `array`: Sessions with an end time that is between startTime and endTime of the request.
    * items [Session](#session)

### MapValue
* MapValue `object`: Holder object for the value of an entry in a map field of a data point.
  * fpVal `number`: Floating point value.

### Session
* Session `object`: Sessions contain metadata, such as a user-friendly name and time interval information.
  * activeTimeMillis `string`: Session active time. While start_time_millis and end_time_millis define the full session time, the active time can be shorter and specified by active_time_millis. If the inactive time during the session is known, it should also be inserted via a com.google.activity.segment data point with a STILL activity value
  * activityType `integer`: The type of activity this session represents.
  * application [Application](#application)
  * description `string`: A description for this session.
  * endTimeMillis `string`: An end time, in milliseconds since epoch, inclusive.
  * id `string`: A client-generated identifier that is unique across all sessions owned by this particular user.
  * modifiedTimeMillis `string`: A timestamp that indicates when the session was last modified.
  * name `string`: A human readable name of the session.
  * startTimeMillis `string`: A start time, in milliseconds since epoch, inclusive.

### Value
* Value `object`: Holder object for the value of a single field in a data point.
  * fpVal `number`: Floating point value. When this is set, other values must not be set.
  * intVal `integer`: Integer value. When this is set, other values must not be set.
  * mapVal `array`: Map value. The valid key space and units for the corresponding value of each entry should be documented as part of the data type definition. Keys should be kept small whenever possible. Data streams with large keys and high data frequency may be down sampled.
    * items [ValueMapValEntry](#valuemapvalentry)
  * stringVal `string`: String value. When this is set, other values must not be set. Strings should be kept small whenever possible. Data streams with large string values and high data frequency may be down sampled.

### ValueMapValEntry
* ValueMapValEntry `object`
  * key `string`
  * value [MapValue](#mapvalue)
