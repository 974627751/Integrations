## Actions
### CompareFaces



```js
amazonaws_rekognition.CompareFaces({
  "SourceImage": {},
  "TargetImage": {}
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* SimilarityThreshold (number)
* SourceImage (object) **required** - <p>Provides the input image either as bytes or an S3 object.</p> <p>You pass image bytes to a Rekognition API operation by using the <code>Bytes</code> property. For example, you would use the <code>Bytes</code> property to pass an image loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed by using the <code>Bytes</code> property must be base64-encoded. Your code may not need to encode image bytes if you are using an AWS SDK to call Rekognition API operations. For more information, see <a>example4</a>.</p> <p> You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to a Rekognition API operation by using the <code>S3Object</code> property. Images stored in an S3 bucket do not need to be base64-encoded.</p> <p>The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.</p> <p>If you use the Amazon CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes using the Bytes property is not supported. You must first upload the image to an Amazon S3 bucket and then call the operation using the S3Object property.</p> <p>For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have permission to access the S3 object. For more information, see <a>manage-access-resource-policies</a>. </p>
* TargetImage (object) **required** - <p>Provides the input image either as bytes or an S3 object.</p> <p>You pass image bytes to a Rekognition API operation by using the <code>Bytes</code> property.
