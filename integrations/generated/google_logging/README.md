### folders.sinks.patch
Updates a sink. This method replaces the following fields in the existing sink with values from the new sink: destination, and filter. The updated sink might also have a new writer_identity; see the unique_writer_identity field.


```js
google_logging.folders.sinks.patch({
  "sinkName": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* body (object) - Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or folder.
* sinkName (string) **required** - Required. The full resource name of the sink to update, including the parent resource and the sink identifier:
* uniqueWriterIdentity (boolean) - Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:
* updateMask (string) - Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:  destination,filter,includeChildren At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#fieldmaskExample: updateMask=filter.
* quotaUser (string) - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
* pp (boolean) - Pretty-print response.
* oauth_token (string) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
* bearer_token (string) - OAuth bearer token.
* upload_protocol (string) - Upload protocol for media (e.g. "raw", "multipart").
* prettyPrint (boolean) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
* uploadType (string) - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. "media", "multipart").
* fields (string) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
* $.xgafv (string) - V1 error format.
* callback (string) - JSONP
* alt (string) - Data format for response.
* access_token (string) - OAuth access token.
* key (string) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
