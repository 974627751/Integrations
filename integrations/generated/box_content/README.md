Offset of 2 would start at the 2nd record, not the second page. Note: If there are hidden items in your previous response, your next offset should be = offset + limit, not the # of records you received back.

### createComment

}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* ID (string) **required**

### getDevicePin
Gets information about an individual device pin.


```js
box_content.getDevicePin({
  "ID": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* ID (string) **required**

### getEnterpriseDevicePins
Gets all the device pins within a given enterprise. Must be an enterprise admin with the manage enterprise scope to make this call.


```js
box_content.getEnterpriseDevicePins({
  "ENTERPRISE_ID": ""
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* ENTERPRISE_ID (string) **required**
* marker (string) - Needs not be passed or can be empty for first invocation of the API. Use the one returned in response for each subsequent call.
* limit (string) - Default value is 100. Max value is 10000
* direction (string) - Default is "asc". Valid values are asc, desc. Case in-sensitive, ASC/DESC works just fine.

### getUserEvents
Use this to get events for a given user. A chunk of event objects is returned for the user based on the parameters passed in. Parameters indicating how many chunks are left as well as the next stream_position are also returned.

To retrieve Enterprise Events specify 'stream_type=admin_logs'. Retrieves up to a year' events for all users in an enterprise. Upper and lower bounds as well as filters can be applied to the results.


```js
box_content.getUserEvents({}, context)
```


### eventLongPolling
To get real-time notification of activity in a Box account, use the long poll feature of the /events API. To do so, first call the /events API with an OPTIONS call to retrieve the long poll URL to use. Next, make a GET request to the provided URL to begin listening for events. If an event occurs within an account you are monitoring, you will receive a response with the value new_change. It’s important to note that this response will not come with any other details, but should serve as a prompt to take further action such as calling the /events endpoint with your last known stream_position. After sending this response, the server will close the connection and you will need to repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.
If no events occur for a period of time after you make the GET request to the long poll URL, you will receive a response with the value reconnect. When you receive this response, you’ll make another OPTIONS call to the /events endpoint and repeat the long poll process.
If you receive no events in retry_timeout seconds, you should make another GET request to the real time server (i.e. URL in the response). This might be necessary in case you do not receive the reconnect message in the face of network errors.
If you receive max_retries error when making GET requests to the real time server, you should make another OPTIONS request.


```js
box_content.eventLongPolling(null, context)
```


### getFileVersionLegalHoldPolicies

* recursive (boolean)
* If-Match (string) - This is in the ‘etag’ field of the folder object.

### getFolder
Retrieves the full metadata about a folder, including information about when it was last updated as well as the files and folders contained in it. The root folder of a Box account is always represented by the id “0”.

}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* fields (string) - Attribute(s) to include in the response
* FOLDER_ID (string) **required**

### restoreTrashedFolder
Restores an item that has been moved to the trash. Default behavior is to restore the item to the folder it was in before it was moved to the trash. If that parent folder no longer exists or if there is now an item with the same name in that parent folder, the new parent folder and/or new name will need to be included in the request.


```js
box_content.restoreTrashedFolder({
  "FOLDER_ID": "",
  "body": {}
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* FOLDER_ID (string) **required**
* fields (string) - Attribute(s) to include in the response
* body (object) **required** - Folders contain information about the items contained inside of them, including files and other folders. There is also a set of metadata such as who owns the folder and when it was modified that is also returned. When accessing other resources that make reference to folders, a ‘mini folder’ object will be used. The 'mini folder' object will return type, id, sequence_id, etag, and name.

### updateFolder
Used to update information about the folder. To move a folder, update the ID of its parent. To enable an email address that can be used to upload files to this folder, update the folder_upload_email attribute. An optional If-Match header can be included to ensure that client only updates the folder if it knows about the latest version.

Used to create a shared link for this particular folder. Please see here for more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e. {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link": null}

To add or remove an item from a collection, you do a PUT on that item and change the list of collections it belongs to. Philosophically, this is similar to the way “move” operations work on files and folders: you do a PUT on the item and change its parent. It’s the same idea with collections, except you’re changing which collection(s) the item belongs to instead of the folder it belongs to. Currently the only collection available is the favorites collection, and you’ll need to know it’s ID for the user that is making the API call, since every user has a different favorites collection_id.
The Add/Remove API handling will check all ids passed in before performing any add/removal operations. If any collection ids are malformed or do not exist in the user’s account, the API call will throw a 400. Only if all of the collection ids are valid will the adds and removals be carried out.


```js
box_content.updateFolder({
  "FOLDER_ID": "",
  "body": {}
}, context)
```

#### Parameters
* FOLDER_ID (string) **required**
* fields (string) - Attribute(s) to include in the response
* body (object) **required** - Folders contain information about the items contained inside of them, including files and other folders. There is also a set of metadata such as who owns the folder and when it was modified that is also returned. When accessing other resources that make reference to folders, a ‘mini folder’ object will be used. The 'mini folder' object will return type, id, sequence_id, etag, and name.
* If-Match (string) - This is in the ‘etag’ field of the folder object.

### getFolderCollaborations
