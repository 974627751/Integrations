This isn't an API call—it's the web page that lets the user sign in to Dropbox and authorize your app. After the user decides whether or not to authorize your app, they will be redirected to the URI specified by redirect_uri . OAuth 2.0 supports two authorization flows: The code flow returns a code via the redirect_uri callback which should then be converted into a bearer token using the /oauth2/token call . This is the recommended flow for apps that are running on a server. The token or implicit grant flow returns the bearer token via the redirect_uri callback, rather than requiring your app to make a second call to a server. This is useful for pure client-side apps, such as mobile apps or JavaScript-based apps. For more information on the two flows, see Section 1.3 of the OAuth 2 spec . If the user isn't already signed in to the Dropbox web site, they will be prompted to do so on this web page. Note that some users use their Google account to sign in to Dropbox. In order to comply with Google's policy against processing the OAuth flow inside a web-view , you should not display this web page inside a web-view.",

Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. media_info MediaInfo ? Additional information if the file is a photo or video. This field is optional. MediaInfo (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: pending Void Indicate the photo/video is still under processing and metadata is not available yet. metadata MediaMetadata The metadata for the photo/video. MediaMetadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a photo or video.

Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. video VideoMetadata VideoMetadata Metadata for a video. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. duration UInt64? The duration of the video in milliseconds. This field is optional. symlink_info SymlinkInfo ? Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.

The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.

Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional.

The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.

The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted.

The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. duration UInt64? The duration of the video in milliseconds. This field is optional. symlink_info SymlinkInfo ? Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.
