Expiration time of value. Some cursors might have expiration time assigned. This is a UTC value after which the cursor is no longer valid and the API starts returning an error. If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results. This field is optional. has_more Boolean Will be set to True if a subsequent call with the provided cursor to docs/users/list/continue returns immediately with some results. If set to False please allow some delay before making another call to docs/users/list/continue .",

This isn't an API call—it's the web page that lets the user sign in to Dropbox and authorize your app. After the user decides whether or not to authorize your app, they will be redirected to the URI specified by redirect_uri . OAuth 2.0 supports two authorization flows: The code flow returns a code via the redirect_uri callback which should then be converted into a bearer token using the /oauth2/token call . This is the recommended flow for apps that are running on a server. The token or implicit grant flow returns the bearer token via the redirect_uri callback, rather than requiring your app to make a second call to a server. This is useful for pure client-side apps, such as mobile apps or JavaScript-based apps. For more information on the two flows, see Section 1.3 of the OAuth 2 spec . If the user isn't already signed in to the Dropbox web site, they will be prompted to do so on this web page. Note that some users use their Google account to sign in to Dropbox. In order to comply with Google's policy against processing the OAuth flow inside a web-view , you should not display this web page inside a web-view.",

This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the file. client_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. media_info MediaInfo ? Additional information if the file is a photo or video. This field is optional. MediaInfo (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: pending Void Indicate the photo/video is still under processing and metadata is not available yet. metadata MediaMetadata The metadata for the photo/video. MediaMetadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a photo or video. This datatype will be one of the following subtypes: photo PhotoMetadata PhotoMetadata Metadata for a photo. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. video VideoMetadata VideoMetadata Metadata for a video. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. duration UInt64? The duration of the video in milliseconds. This field is optional. symlink_info SymlinkInfo ? Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page. This field is optional. thumbnail String A string containing the base64-encoded thumbnail data for this file. failure ThumbnailError The result for this file if it was an error. ThumbnailError (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: path LookupError An error occurs when downloading metadata for the image. LookupError (open union) The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. malformed_path String? The given path does not satisfy the required path format. Please refer to the Path formats documentation for more information. This field is optional. not_found Void There is nothing at the given path. not_file Void We were expecting a file, but the given path refers to something that isn't a file. not_folder Void We were expecting a folder, but the given path refers to something that isn't a folder. restricted_content Void The file cannot be transferred because the content is restricted. For example, sometimes there are legal restrictions due to copyright claims. unsupported_extension Void The file extension doesn't allow conversion to a thumbnail. unsupported_image Void The image cannot be converted to a thumbnail. conversion_error Void An error occurs during thumbnail conversion.",

FileMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the file. client_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. media_info MediaInfo ? Additional information if the file is a photo or video. This field is optional. MediaInfo (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: pending Void Indicate the photo/video is still under processing and metadata is not available yet. metadata MediaMetadata The metadata for the photo/video. MediaMetadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a photo or video. This datatype will be one of the following subtypes: photo PhotoMetadata PhotoMetadata Metadata for a photo. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. video VideoMetadata VideoMetadata Metadata for a video. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. duration UInt64? The duration of the video in milliseconds. This field is optional. symlink_info SymlinkInfo ? Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page. This field is optional. failed SaveUrlError SaveUrlError (open union) The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. path WriteError WriteError (open union) The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. malformed_path String? The given path does not satisfy the required path format. Please refer to the Path formats documentation for more information. This field is optional. conflict WriteConflictError Couldn't write to the target path because there was something in the way. WriteConflictError (open union) The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. file Void There's a file in the way. folder Void There's a folder in the way. file_ancestor Void There's a file at an ancestor path, so we couldn't create the required parent folders. no_write_permission Void The user doesn't have permissions to write to the target location. insufficient_space Void The user doesn't have enough available space (bytes) to write more data. disallowed_name Void Dropbox will not save the file or folder because of its name. team_folder Void This endpoint cannot move or delete team folders. too_many_write_operations Void There are too many write operations in user's Dropbox. Please retry this request. download_failed Void Failed downloading the given URL. invalid_url Void The given URL is invalid. not_found Void The file where the URL is saved to no longer exists.",

            "description": "SaveCopyReferenceResult metadata Metadata The metadata of the saved file or folder in the user's Dropbox. Metadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a file or folder. This datatype will be one of the following subtypes: file FileMetadata FileMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the file. client_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. media_info MediaInfo ? Additional information if the file is a photo or video. This field is optional. MediaInfo (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: pending Void Indicate the photo/video is still under processing and metadata is not available yet. metadata MediaMetadata The metadata for the photo/video. MediaMetadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a photo or video. This datatype will be one of the following subtypes: photo PhotoMetadata PhotoMetadata Metadata for a photo. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. video VideoMetadata VideoMetadata Metadata for a video. dimensions Dimensions ? Dimension of the photo/video. This field is optional. Dimensions Dimensions for a photo or video. height UInt64 Height of the photo/video. width UInt64 Width of the photo/video. location GpsCoordinates ? The GPS coordinate of the photo/video. This field is optional. GpsCoordinates GPS coordinates for a photo or video. latitude Float64 Latitude of the GPS coordinates. longitude Float64 Longitude of the GPS coordinates. time_taken Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? The timestamp when the photo/video is taken. This field is optional. duration UInt64? The duration of the video in milliseconds. This field is optional. symlink_info SymlinkInfo ? Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page. This field is optional. folder FolderMetadata FolderMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the folder. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash.

Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use sharing_info instead. This field is optional. sharing_info FolderSharingInfo ? Set if the folder is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. This field is optional. FolderSharingInfo Sharing info for a folder which is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Set if the folder is contained by a shared folder. This field is optional. shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? If this folder is a shared folder mount point, the ID of the shared folder mounted at this location. This field is optional. traverse_only Boolean Specifies that the folder can only be traversed and the user can only see a limited subset of the contents of this folder because they don't have read access to this folder. They do, however, have access to some sub folder. The default for this field is False. no_access Boolean Specifies that the folder cannot be accessed by the user. The default for this field is False. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. Note that only properties associated with user-owned templates, not team-owned templates, can be attached to folders. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template.

Contains the path and other optional modifiers for the commit. Path in the user's Dropbox to save the file. Selects what to do if the file already exists. The default for this union is add. Do not overwrite an existing file if there is a conflict. The autorename strategy is to append a number to the file name. For example, \"document.txt\" might become \"document (2).txt\". Always overwrite the existing file. The autorename strategy is the same as it is for add. Overwrite if the given \"rev\" matches the existing file's \"rev\". The autorename strategy is to append the string \"conflicted copy\" to the file name. For example, \"document.txt\" might become \"document (conflicted copy).txt\" or \"document (Panda's conflicted copy).txt\". If there's a conflict, as determined by mode, have the Dropbox server try to autorename the file to avoid conflict. The default for this field is False. The value to store as the client_modified timestamp. Dropbox automatically records the time at which the file was written to the Dropbox servers. It can also record an additional timestamp, provided by Dropbox desktop clients, mobile clients, and API apps of when the file was actually created or modified. This field is optional. Normally, users are made aware of any file modifications in their Dropbox account via notifications in the client software. If true, this tells the clients that this modification shouldn't result in a user notification. The default for this field is False. List of custom properties to add to file. This field is optional. A unique identifier for the associated template. The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. Be more strict about how each WriteMode detects conflict. For example, always return a conflict error when mode = WriteMode.update and the given \"rev\" doesn't match the existing file's \"rev\", even if the existing file has been deleted. The default for this field is False."

We recommend uploading many files in parallel to increase throughput. Once the file contents have been uploaded, rather than calling upload_session/finish , use this route to finish all your upload sessions in a single request. UploadSessionStartArg.close or UploadSessionAppendArg.close needs to be true for the last upload_session/start or upload_session/append:2 call. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. This route will return a job_id immediately and do the async commit job in background. Use upload_session/finish_batch/check to check the job status. For the same account, this route should be executed serially. That means you should not start the next job before current job finishes. We allow up to 1000 entries in a single request.

This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results.

Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. media_info MediaInfo ? Additional information if the file is a photo or video. This field is optional. MediaInfo (union) The value will be one of the following datatypes: pending Void Indicate the photo/video is still under processing and metadata is not available yet. metadata MediaMetadata The metadata for the photo/video.

FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page. This field is optional. folder FolderMetadata FolderMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the folder. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use sharing_info instead. This field is optional. sharing_info FolderSharingInfo ? Set if the folder is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. This field is optional. FolderSharingInfo Sharing info for a folder which is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Set if the folder is contained by a shared folder. This field is optional. shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? If this folder is a shared folder mount point, the ID of the shared folder mounted at this location. This field is optional. traverse_only Boolean Specifies that the folder can only be traversed and the user can only see a limited subset of the contents of this folder because they don't have read access to this folder. They do, however, have access to some sub folder. The default for this field is False. no_access Boolean Specifies that the folder cannot be accessed by the user. The default for this field is False. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. Note that only properties associated with user-owned templates, not team-owned templates, can be attached to folders. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template.

            "description": "ListFolderResult entries List of ( Metadata ) The files and (direct) subfolders in the folder. Metadata (datatype with subtypes) Metadata for a file or folder. This datatype will be one of the following subtypes: file FileMetadata FileMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the file. client_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated.

Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.

Set if the folder is contained by a shared folder. This field is optional. shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? If this folder is a shared folder mount point, the ID of the shared folder mounted at this location. This field is optional. traverse_only Boolean Specifies that the folder can only be traversed and the user can only see a limited subset of the contents of this folder because they don't have read access to this folder. They do, however, have access to some sub folder. The default for this field is False. no_access Boolean Specifies that the folder cannot be accessed by the user. The default for this field is False. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. Note that only properties associated with user-owned templates, not team-owned templates, can be attached to folders. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template.

GroupManagementType (open union) The group type determines how a group is managed. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the team_common namespace. The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. user_managed Void A group which is managed by selected users. company_managed Void A group which is managed by team admins only. system_managed Void A group which is managed automatically by Dropbox. created UInt64 The group creation time as a UTC timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. group_external_id String? External ID of group. This is an arbitrary ID that an admin can attach to a group. This field is optional. member_count UInt32? The number of members in the group.

The value will be one of the following datatypes: active Void User has successfully joined the team. invited Void User has been invited to a team, but has not joined the team yet. suspended Void User is no longer a member of the team, but the account can be un-suspended, re-establishing the user as a team member. removed RemovedStatus User is no longer a member of the team. Removed users are only listed when include_removed is true in members/list. RemovedStatus is_recoverable Boolean True if the removed team member is recoverable. is_disconnected Boolean True if the team member's account was converted to individual account. name Name Representations for a person's name. Name Representations for a person's name to assist with internationalization. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the users namespace. given_name String Also known as a first name. surname String Also known as a last name or family name. familiar_name String Locale-dependent name.

GroupManagementType (open union) The group type determines how a group is managed. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the team_common namespace. The value will be one of the following datatypes. New values may be introduced as our API evolves. user_managed Void A group which is managed by selected users. company_managed Void A group which is managed by team admins only. system_managed Void A group which is managed automatically by Dropbox. created UInt64 The group creation time as a UTC timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. group_external_id String? External ID of group. This is an arbitrary ID that an admin can attach to a group. This field is optional. member_count UInt32? The number of members in the group. This field is optional. members List of ( GroupMemberInfo )? List of group members. This field is optional. GroupMemberInfo Profile of group member, and role in group. profile MemberProfile Profile of group member. MemberProfile Basic member profile. team_member_id String ID of user as a member of a team. email String Email address of user. email_verified Boolean Is true if the user's email is verified to be owned by the user. status TeamMemberStatus The user's status as a member of a specific team. TeamMemberStatus (union) The user's status as a member of a specific team. The value will be one of the following datatypes: active Void User has successfully joined the team. invited Void User has been invited to a team, but has not joined the team yet. suspended Void User is no longer a member of the team, but the account can be un-suspended, re-establishing the user as a team member. removed RemovedStatus User is no longer a member of the team. Removed users are only listed when include_removed is true in members/list. RemovedStatus is_recoverable Boolean True if the removed team member is recoverable. is_disconnected Boolean True if the team member's account was converted to individual account. name Name Representations for a person's name. Name Representations for a person's name to assist with internationalization. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the users namespace. given_name String Also known as a first name. surname String Also known as a last name or family name. familiar_name String Locale-dependent name.

If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results. This field is optional. has_more Boolean Will be set to True if a subsequent call with the provided cursor to docs/list/continue returns immediately with some results. If set to False please allow some delay before making another call to docs/list/continue .",

If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results.

The cursor preserves all properties as specified in the original call to docs/folder_users/list . Cursor value String The actual cursor value. expiration Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? Expiration time of value. Some cursors might have expiration time assigned. This is a UTC value after which the cursor is no longer valid and the API starts returning an error. If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results. This field is optional. has_more Boolean Will be set to True if a subsequent call with the provided cursor to docs/folder_users/list/continue returns immediately with some results.

The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page.

This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the file. client_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") For files, this is the modification time set by the desktop client when the file was added to Dropbox. Since this time is not verified (the Dropbox server stores whatever the desktop client sends up), this should only be used for display purposes (such as sorting) and not, for example, to determine if a file has changed or not. server_modified Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\") The last time the file was modified on Dropbox. rev String(min_length=9, pattern=\"[0-9a-f]+\") A unique identifier for the current revision of a file. This field is the same rev as elsewhere in the API and can be used to detect changes and avoid conflicts. size UInt64 The file size in bytes. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted.

Set if this file is a symlink. This field is optional. SymlinkInfo target String The target this symlink points to. sharing_info FileSharingInfo ? Set if this file is contained in a shared folder. This field is optional. FileSharingInfo Sharing info for a file which is contained by a shared folder. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\") ID of shared folder that holds this file. modified_by String(min_length=40, max_length=40)? The last user who modified the file. This field will be null if the user's account has been deleted. This field is optional. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. has_explicit_shared_members Boolean? This flag will only be present if include_has_explicit_shared_members is true in list_folder or get_metadata . If this flag is present, it will be true if this file has any explicit shared members. This is different from sharing_info in that this could be true in the case where a file has explicit members but is not contained within a shared folder. This field is optional. content_hash String(min_length=64, max_length=64)? A hash of the file content. This field can be used to verify data integrity. For more information see our Content hash page. This field is optional. folder FolderMetadata FolderMetadata name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. id String(min_length=1) A unique identifier for the folder. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use sharing_info instead. This field is optional. sharing_info FolderSharingInfo ? Set if the folder is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. This field is optional. FolderSharingInfo Sharing info for a folder which is contained in a shared folder or is a shared folder mount point. read_only Boolean True if the file or folder is inside a read-only shared folder. parent_shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Set if the folder is contained by a shared folder. This field is optional. shared_folder_id String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? If this folder is a shared folder mount point, the ID of the shared folder mounted at this location. This field is optional. traverse_only Boolean Specifies that the folder can only be traversed and the user can only see a limited subset of the contents of this folder because they don't have read access to this folder. They do, however, have access to some sub folder. The default for this field is False. no_access Boolean Specifies that the folder cannot be accessed by the user. The default for this field is False. property_groups List of ( PropertyGroup )? Additional information if the file has custom properties with the property template specified. Note that only properties associated with user-owned templates, not team-owned templates, can be attached to folders. This field is optional. PropertyGroup A subset of the property fields described by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. Properties are always added to a Dropbox file as a PropertyGroup. The possible key names and value types in this group are defined by the corresponding PropertyGroupTemplate. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. template_id String(min_length=1, pattern=\"(/|ptid:).*\") A unique identifier for the associated template. fields List of ( PropertyField ) The actual properties associated with the template. There can be up to 32 property types per template. PropertyField Raw key/value data to be associated with a Dropbox file. Property fields are added to Dropbox files as a PropertyGroup. This datatype comes from an imported namespace originally defined in the file_properties namespace. name String Key of the property field associated with a file and template. Keys can be up to 256 bytes. value String Value of the property field associated with a file and template. Values can be up to 1024 bytes. deleted DeletedMetadata DeletedMetadata Indicates that there used to be a file or folder at this path, but it no longer exists. name String The last component of the path (including extension). This never contains a slash. path_lower String? The lowercased full path in the user's Dropbox. This always starts with a slash. This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. path_display String? The cased path to be used for display purposes only. In rare instances the casing will not correctly match the user's filesystem, but this behavior will match the path provided in the Core API v1, and at least the last path component will have the correct casing. Changes to only the casing of paths won't be returned by list_folder/continue . This field will be null if the file or folder is not mounted. This field is optional. parent_shared_folder_id deprecated String(pattern=\"[-_0-9a-zA-Z:]+\")? Field is deprecated. Please use FileSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id or FolderSharingInfo.parent_shared_folder_id instead. This field is optional. more Boolean Used for paging. If true, indicates there is another page of results available that can be fetched by calling search again. start UInt64 Used for paging. Value to set the start argument to when calling search to fetch the next page of results.",

The cursor preserves all properties as specified in the original call to docs/list . Cursor value String The actual cursor value. expiration Timestamp(format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")? Expiration time of value. Some cursors might have expiration time assigned. This is a UTC value after which the cursor is no longer valid and the API starts returning an error. If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results. This field is optional. has_more Boolean Will be set to True if a subsequent call with the provided cursor to docs/list/continue returns immediately with some results.
