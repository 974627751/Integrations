This will serve a swagger-ui webinterface for trying out & viewing your datafire endpoints.

> NOTE: executing endpoints only works on productionservers (datafire on port 80). This is because datafire does not specify the port in the baseurl of /openapi.json.
This shouldn't be a problem since you probably want to use the datafire CLI for local testing anyways.
