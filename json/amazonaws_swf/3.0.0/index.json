  "description": "Amazon Simple Workflow Service\n\nThe Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a _task_ represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.\n\nAmazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.\n\nThis documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the _[Amazon SWF Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/)_ .",

This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision is not registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed</b>: a ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed decision failed. This could happen if the AWS Lambda function specified in the decision does not exist, or the AWS Lambda service's limits are exceeded.</li> <li> <b>RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed</b>: a RequestCancelActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.</li> <li> <b>StartTimerFailed</b>: a StartTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.</li> <li> <b>CancelTimerFailed</b>: a CancelTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.</li> <li> <b>StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a StartChildWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified is not registered, is deprecated, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a SignalExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect.</li> <li> <b>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect.</li> <li> <b>CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a CancelWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.</li> <li> <b>CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a CompleteWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.</li> <li> <b>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly.</li> <li> <b>FailWorkflowExecutionFailed</b>: a FailWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.</li> </ul> <p>The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error.</p> <note>A workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the following decisions when completing a decision task: <code>CompleteWorkflowExecution</code>, <code>FailWorkflowExecution</code>, <code>CancelWorkflowExecution</code> and <code>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution</code>. An UnhandledDecision fault will be returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call <a>RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a> without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.</note> <p><b>How to code a decision</b></p> <p>You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below:</p> <ul> <li> <a>ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>ScheduleLambdaFunctionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>StartTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>CancelTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> <li> <a>StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </li> </ul>",
