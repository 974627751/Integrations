Because contracts solicited to OASIS vendors can only be issued to one pool, much of the data is presented as part of a pool grouping. Using the NAICS code is a shortcut, so that you don't have to explicitly map the NAICS code to a pool in OASIS yourself.\n\nVendors can also be filtered by a particular setaside. Valid values for the setasides are two-character codes which include:\n\n*   A6 (8(a))\n*   XX (Hubzone)\n*   QF (service disabled veteran owned)\n*   A2 (women owned)\n*   A5 (veteran owned)\n*   27 (small disadvantaged business).",
