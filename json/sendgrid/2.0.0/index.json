Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser.

However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.\n\nA domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails.
